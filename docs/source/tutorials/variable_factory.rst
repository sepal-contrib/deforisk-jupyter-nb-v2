Variable Factory Tutorial
=========================

Understanding Variables
-----------------------

What Are Variables?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the context of deforestation analysis, a **variable** is any data layer that might influence or describe forest loss. Think of variables as ingredients you're collecting for your analysis recipe.

Examples of variables include:

- **Forest cover maps**: Showing where forests exist
- **Roads**: Infrastructure that provides access to forests
- **Protected areas**: National parks, reserves, and conservation zones
- **Topography**: Elevation, slope - forests on steep slopes might be safer
- **Settlements**: Cities, towns, villages - sources of pressure on forests
- **Agriculture**: Crop areas that might expand into forests

The "factory" pattern in this framework means you have a standardized way to create, organize, and manage all these different data sources.

Types of Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework works with three main types of variables:

**1. GEE Variables (GEEVar)**

These come from Google Earth Engine - a massive catalog of satellite imagery and global datasets. The advantage? You don't need to download gigabytes of data manually. You just request what you need for your area.

Examples: Hansen forest cover, population density, rainfall data, protected areas databases.

**2. Local Raster Variables (LocalRasterVar)**

These are grid-based datasets you already have on your computer, like GeoTIFF files. Each cell in the grid has a value (elevation, temperature, etc.).

Examples: High-resolution forest maps from national agencies, digital elevation models, climate data.

**3. Local Vector Variables (LocalVectorVar)**

These are feature-based datasets with points, lines, or polygons. They define specific locations or boundaries.

Examples: Shapefiles of roads, boundaries of protected areas, locations of logging concessions.

Building Your Variable Collection
----------------------------------

The Process
~~~~~~~~~~~

Think of building your variable collection like assembling a toolkit. You're gathering all the data layers you think might help explain deforestation patterns in your area.

The typical process looks like this:

1. **Start with your Area of Interest** - Define where you're working
2. **Add forest layers** - Your main outcome variable
3. **Add driver variables** - Things that might cause deforestation
4. **Add contextual variables** - Environmental and geographic context
5. **Organize with tags** - Group related variables together

Each variable gets a meaningful name, metadata about what it represents, and optional tags for organization.

Working with Google Earth Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Google Earth Engine gives you access to incredible datasets without downloading terabytes of data. Here's what you can access:

**Global Forest Change (Hansen)**

The most widely used global forest dataset, updated annually. Shows tree cover, loss, and gain from 2000 to present.

.. code-block:: python

   # Example: Getting forest cover for 2015
   gfcImage = ee.Image("UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2024_v1_12")
   forest2000 = gfcImage.select(["treecover2000"])

**Protected Areas (WDPA)**

Global database of protected areas, parks, and reserves.

.. code-block:: python

   # Get protected areas
   wdpa = ee.FeatureCollection("WCMC/WDPA/current/polygons")

**Topography (SRTM)**

Elevation data covering most of the world at 30-meter resolution.

.. code-block:: python

   # Get elevation
   srtm = ee.Image("CGIAR/SRTM90_V4")

The framework handles the complexity of downloading these datasets just for your area of interest.

Working with Local Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, you'll have data from local sources that's more accurate or recent than global datasets. The framework makes it easy to integrate:

**Local Rasters**

If you have GeoTIFF or other raster files:

.. code-block:: python

   from component.script.variables import LocalRasterVar
   
   local_dem = LocalRasterVar(
       name="high_res_dem",
       path="/path/to/elevation.tif",
       project=project,
       tags=["topography"]
   )

**Local Vectors**

If you have shapefiles or other vector formats:

.. code-block:: python

   from component.script.variables import LocalVectorVar
   
   local_roads = LocalVectorVar(
       name="national_roads",
       path="/path/to/roads.shp",
       project=project,
       tags=["infrastructure"]
   )

The framework will handle converting vectors to rasters when needed for analysis.

Temporal Variables
------------------

Understanding Time in Your Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deforestation analysis often needs to look at how things change over time. The framework supports **temporal variables** - data that varies across different years.

For example:

- Forest cover in 2015, 2020, and 2024
- Population growth over time
- Expansion of agricultural areas

When you create your project with multiple years, you can create variables for each year:

.. code-block:: python

   project = Project(
       project_name="temporal_analysis",
       years=[2015, 2020, 2024]
   )
   
   # Create forest variable for each year
   for year in project.years:
       forest_var = GEEVar(
           name=f"forest_{year}",
           year=year,  # Associate with specific year
           # ... other parameters
       )

This allows you to analyze:

- How much forest was lost between periods
- Whether deforestation is accelerating or slowing
- How driver variables changed over time

Organizing with Tags
--------------------

Why Use Tags?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As your variable collection grows, tags help you stay organized. Tags are simple labels you attach to variables so you can group and filter them later.

Example tagging strategy:

- **forest**: All forest-related layers
- **infrastructure**: Roads, settlements, airports
- **protected**: Protected areas and conservation zones
- **topography**: Elevation, slope, aspect
- **drivers**: Variables that might cause deforestation

Using tags:

.. code-block:: python

   # Create variable with tags
   forest_var = GEEVar(
       name="forest_2020",
       tags=["forest", "temporal"],
       # ... other parameters
   )
   
   # Later, find all forest variables
   forest_vars = project.get_variables_by_tag("forest")

The Factory Notebooks
---------------------

Detailed Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``_1.variables_factory.ipynb`` notebook provides complete, working examples of:

- Setting up a project from scratch
- Connecting to Google Earth Engine
- Creating variables from different sources
- Organizing variables with tags
- Saving and loading projects

The notebook includes real examples for different regions and use cases. Rather than copying all that code here, we encourage you to:

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Read through the explanations
3. Run each cell step by step
4. Modify the examples for your own area

Key Concepts from the Notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The notebook demonstrates:

**Project Workflow**

How to create, save, and reload projects so you can work across multiple sessions.

**AOI Definition**

Multiple ways to define your study area - from country boundaries to custom polygons.

**Variable Creation Patterns**

Standard approaches for creating different types of variables consistently.

**Data Organization**

How the framework organizes raw versus processed data, and how to keep track of everything.

**Quality Checks**

Simple ways to verify your variables were created correctly before moving to processing.

Best Practices
--------------

Tips for Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Start Small**

Begin with a small area and a few variables. Make sure everything works before scaling up.

**2. Use Meaningful Names**

Name variables descriptively: ``forest_gfc_30_2015`` is better than ``var1``.

**3. Document Your Sources**

Keep notes about where each variable came from and any processing applied.

**4. Check Your AOI**

Visualize your area of interest to make sure it's correct before downloading data.

**5. Use Tags Consistently**

Develop a tagging scheme and stick to it throughout your project.

**6. Save Regularly**

Use ``project.save()`` frequently to preserve your work.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

❌ **Creating too many variables at once** - Start with essential variables only

❌ **Inconsistent naming** - Use a clear naming convention from the start

❌ **Forgetting to specify years** - For temporal analysis, always include the year

❌ **Not checking data quality** - Visualize variables to catch issues early

❌ **Mixing coordinate systems** - Let the framework handle reprojection (covered in Process Factory)
